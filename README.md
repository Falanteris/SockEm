# SockEm - A Live Connection Scanner  

## Features  

- Checks active connections against commonly used **Threat Hunting** knowledge bases.  
- **Zero dependencies** – Works on any OS with Python 3 installed (no `pip` or external libraries required).

## What Does It Check?

- **Ports** – Open and listening ports.  
- **Processes** – Identifies processes associated with network activity.  

...And audits them against threat intelligence sources.
